# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Assist Louis in data exploration and analysis in crowdfunding for raising capital for her play through kick starter. Analyze the data to find trends to give Louis information to successfully raise $10,000 for her play.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Utilizes pivot tables and pivot charts to spot trends in theater campaign successfulness based on launch date. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Creates a table to examine "plays" succes rate. Uses sum if function and charts for analysis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There weren't many challenges with this data. One questions or step that was possibly overlooked is converting the currency if the goal and pledged amounts are in 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The data shows that there is some seasonality on the successfulness of theater fundraisers. May-June are the best dates to launch the kickstarter. During this time frame there are also no spikes in failed fundraisers. May followed by June have the highest bunber of launched kickstatrers, I would reccommend to plan to launch the campaign during this timeframe.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Plays with a goal of $10,000 have about a 55% success rate. Most of the succsessful campaigns have an average of 118 of donors and the average donation is in the ballpark of $120. This is what Louis should shoot for, power in number of donors. All of the failed plays, didn't get to 50% of the goal so Louis should have a good idea on if her play will make it as there are no "almost made the goal" historical examples. The US has the highest number of successful campaigns.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The data set has enough information to derive some information. I think a date that goal was met (not neccesarily the deadline) would be helpful to understand if Lious will need the whole timeframe and understand the trends on which the money is donated. Sources would also be helpful - did people donate from seeing information on a social media post? word of mouth? or maybe even just from browsing through kickstarter? This information would be helpful to know how to market the project and expose the fundraiser to potential donors.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

you could dive into the location, or take  closer look at the number of donors and average donations. Might be worth looking into staff_pick or spotligh to understand this better and if ithas any impacton outcome.
